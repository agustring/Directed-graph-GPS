# Directed-graph-GPS
A directed graph GPS implementation in C++ (qt 5.13 compiler) with GUI

In general terms, the design of this program is based on a directed graph, which represents a map of a portion of an urban area, where its nodes are the intersections and the connection between them represents both the street that unites them.

In addition, being implemented with adjacency lists instead of adjacency matrices, the use of memory and the size of the executable is considerably optimized, in addition to the use of them both to obtain data and to manage them.
